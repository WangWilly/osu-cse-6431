    - Execute: `./scripts/runLab1.sh Database`


## Lab1

### Deadlock Prevention

Prompt: Since all rows are known before executing a transaction, you should be able to avoid the deadlock problem.

- ‚ùå Deadlock Detection: Regularly check for cycles in the resource allocation graph and abort transactions to break deadlocks.
- üöß Deadlock Prevention: Ensure that the system will never enter a deadlock state.
    - **Hold and Wait**: Require processes to request all resources at once and prevent them from requesting additional resources while holding resources.
    - (For 2-phase locking) Lock all resources before starting the transaction by ordering the resources and requesting them in order.

### TODO

- [ ] Implement the history of operations in the database.
- [ ] Compute the serialization graph of the transactions from the history.
- [ ] Enumerate all possible serial schedules.
- [ ] Use flow algorithms to find a serial schedule from the serialization graph.
